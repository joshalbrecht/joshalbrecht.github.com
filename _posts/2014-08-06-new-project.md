After many months of searching, I've finally found a project that is worth dedicating the next 5 years of my life.

It took a while. I explored many different industries (health, programming tools and services, advertising, quantified self, consumer appliances, and many more), and pitched tons of people on a lot of random things. I am extremetely grateful for everyone who gave me the feedback that invalidated my hundreds of other ideas.

I also talked to a number of other companies and entrepreneurs at the very earliest stages of their companies, and strongly considered joining a few. Again, I'm extremely thankful for the time they took to show me the inner workings of their businesses and markets, and I wish them all the best of luck.

My two main criteria for selecting my next venture were that:

- I have > 99% certainty that the eventual market will be at least $10B.
- I have > 99% certainty that our product will be at least 3x better than the next best alternative when released.

The current idea exceeds both of those criteria, and has additional benefits (allows me to work with amazing people, in an area that gives me useful skills for the future, etc)

Unfortunately, the strategy for this particular idea requires stealth in the early phases, so I can't release any details yet. I always thought stealth was stupid, and this was the only idea of all of them I considered for which stealth was an important component of the strategy, but alas, here we are. 

Though I'm far from a prolific blogger, I'm already looking forward to the day when I can write my next blog post :)
