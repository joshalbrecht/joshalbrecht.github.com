### A brief history of me

1984-12-10: Born

(this part is very fuzzy)

1990-01-01: Somewhere in here, got access to my first computer. Lots of video games and NES after this point.

1997-06-01: Start reading a 1000 page book about programming in C++

1997-07-15: Finished reading. Start programming my own games.

2002-08-30: Finish my first (and only ever) internship, at Kodak. Decide that I hate large companies and vow to never work at one.

2003-06-22: Graduate from high school (Canandaigua Academy, NY)

2003-08-30: Enter University of Pittsburgh. Work as a remote consultant for video game companies using the Torque (modified Tribes 2) engine.

2005-01-01: Start sailing around the world on Semester at Sea. Almost die in the North Pacific. Totally worth it.

2007-05-01: Start doing machine learning and NLP research with Dr. Hwa

2008-05-01: Decide that research is fun, but not what I want to do forever. Start figuring out how to start my own company.

2009-08-30: Graduate from the University of Pittsburgh with a BA in CS and Math, a Masters in CS, and some publications.

2010-01-01: Enter AlphaLab technology accelerator with BitBlinder (software for privacy and anonymity)

2011-05-01: After tons of interest, millions of page views, 50,000 users, BitBlinder shuts down due to lack of profitable opportunities. Good technology, poor business.

2011-09-01: Join up with Nick Pinkston on CloudFab, software for industrial users of 3D-printing

2012-02-01: Sell CloudFab to the largest producer of Objet 3D-printed parts in the US.

2012-05-13: Move to California and join Addepar to create software for managing the world's financial information.

2013-09-04: Write this history.

The above dates are approximate until I have time to go back and figure out exactly.
