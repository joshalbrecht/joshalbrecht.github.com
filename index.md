I am a lucky entrepreneur and a rational techno-optimist. I also make computers do things sometimes.

My mission is to allocate humanity's efforts to projects that will improve the welfare of all. Such projects include [scientific research](http://www.buckinstitute.org/), [grand projects](http://www.spacex.com/mars), and [humanitarian efforts](http://www.givewell.org/). 

If you'd like to help or just say hello, feel free to simply [email me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}). Tell me how I can help you!
