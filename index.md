Co-founder of [Generally Intelligent](https://generallyintelligent.ai/). 
Our mission is to understand the fundamentals of learning and build safe, humane machine intelligence.

See our open jobs [here](https://generally-intelligent.breezy.hr/) or [reach out](mailto:{{ site.email }}) directly if you share an interest in developing software that actually understands the world!

I also host the Genearlly Intelligent [podcast](https://generallyintelligent.ai/), a series of interviews with AI researchers about their work.

Former CTO of [Sourceress](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/sourceress-raises-3-5m-to-find-candidates-that-managers-want-without-realizing-it/) (YC S17), CTO of CloudFab (acquired in 2012), and academic ML / NLP researcher under [Rebecca Hwa](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/).

In my spare time I enjoy reading, writing haikus, and angel investing.
