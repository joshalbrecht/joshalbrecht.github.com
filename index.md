I am the luckiest software engineer and entreprenuer.

I'm currently working on my personal project backlog and taking some time to learn about new areas of technology. Some areas of recent interest include virtual assistants, quantified self, wearable devices, hardware, manufacturing, machine learning, and building software while taking the time to adhere to all software development best practices.

If you'd like to learn more or say hello, check out my [about](/about.html) page or simply [email me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).

Tell me how I can help you!
