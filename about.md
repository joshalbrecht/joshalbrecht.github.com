### Skills

- Programming (~16,000 hours combined of C++, Python, Java, Scala, Javascript, C, Lua, Perl, PHP, and more)
- Business (started two companies, sold one)
- Software platform architecture (planned and built a 100K LOC system that modeled all of the world's financial information for Addepar)
- Machine learning (published multiple papers using SVMs to optimize machine translation evaluation)
- Speed reading
- Thinking (interested in cognitive biases, heuristics, rationality, etc)

### Domains

- Software (everything above firmware)
- Manufacturing (created system that automatically determines the cost of manufacturing an arbitrary CAD file using 3D printing or injection molding)
- Gaming (created my own games and engines. Got paid to work with AAA engines as a game programmer in high school and college)
- Finance (2 years on the Data team at Addepar)
- Natural language processing (published multiple papers in the best computational linguistics journals)
- User interfaces (designed a hybrid human/machine translation system, conducted user study and published paper)

### Current interests

- Meeting new smart people
- Virtual reality
- Computer vision
- Optics
- Improving at life, programming, and everything

Please [email me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}) if you're interested in any of the above, especially if you live in the Bay area!

### Far future plans

I currently either don't have the time or resources, but am interested in the following:

- Curing death
- Reducing existential risk
- Improving education

### A brief history of me

1984-12-10: Born

(this part is very fuzzy)

1990-01-01: Somewhere in here, got access to my first computer. Lots of video games and NES after this point.

1997-06-01: Start reading a 1000 page book about programming in C++

1997-07-15: Finished reading. Start programming my own games.

2001-07-15: Built my own computer, including the case, from scratch. It was a portable desktop (had a handle, top flipped open and contained an LCD). Best price/performance ratio available for something mobile.

2002-08-30: Finish my first (and only ever) internship, at Kodak. Decide that I hate large companies and vow to never work at one.

2003-06-22: Graduate from high school (Canandaigua Academy, NY)

2003-08-15: Finished construction of a 20' long boat. Designed and produced at low cost within a few months.

2003-08-30: Enter University of Pittsburgh. Work as a remote consultant for video game companies using the Torque (modified Tribes 2) engine.

2005-01-01: Start sailing around the world on Semester at Sea. Almost die in the North Pacific. Totally worth it.

2006-05-01: Start doing machine learning and NLP research with Dr. Hwa

2007-05-01: Decide that research is fun, but not what I want to do forever. Start learning how to start my own company.

2008-08-30: Graduate from the University of Pittsburgh with a BA in CS and Math, a Masters in CS, and some publications.

2009-01-01: Enter AlphaLab technology accelerator with BitBlinder (software for privacy and anonymity)

2010-05-01: After tons of interest, millions of page views, 50,000 users, BitBlinder shuts down due to lack of profitable opportunities. Good technology, poor business.

2010-09-01: Join up with Nick Pinkston on CloudFab, software for industrial users of 3D-printing and injection molding. Saw hundreds of designs for injection molded parts and learned a ton about manufacturing.

2012-02-01: Sell CloudFab to the largest producer of Objet 3D-printed parts in the US.

2012-05-10: Finished producing software and product for OYO glasses--custom 3D printed eyewear. Did everything from iteratively creating prototypes and exploring various manufacturing processes (finishing, tumbling, coating, custom lens creation, sourcing hinges and boxes from China) to the novel software front-end to create custom designs, and the backend to turn those designs into 3D models completely algorithmically.

2012-05-13: Move to California and join Addepar to create software for managing the world's financial information.

2014-03-01: Left Addepar because I could not resist the urge to build my own company again.

2014-06-25: After exploring (prototyping/invalidating) more than 100 ideas in a wide variety of industries, finally decided on what I will build next. Unfortunately it requires a bit of stealth in the beginning, but please reach out if you're interested!


The above dates are approximate until I have time to go back and figure out exactly.
