I am a lucky entrepreneur, a rational techno-optimist, and a devoted software engineering disciple who is madly in love with hardware and manufacturing.

After (relatively brief) recent exploratory period, I've decided what I want to spend the next 5 years of my life building.
Unfortunately I can't share anything publicly yet, but if you're interested in the intersection of virtual reality, manufacturing, computer vision and optics, I will buy you dinner.

If you'd like to learn more or say hello, check out my [about](/about.html) page or simply [email me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).

Also--tell me how I can help you!
